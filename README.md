# Chat Notify

This is a client-side Minecraft mod for Fabric and Forge that allows the 
user to set up audio and visual notifications for when specified words or 
phrases appear in chat.

## Features and Usage

The Fabric version mod requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for 
configuration (if you aren't using it already, now's a great time to start).

### Performance

Reasonable effort has been taken to reduce workload, but ultimately it still
has to process every chat message. That said, it is unlikely that you will be able 
to detect any performance impact unless you have very large numbers of 
notifications and/or your chat is being spammed extremely fast (e.g. by 
multiple repeating command-blocks).
