# Chat Notify

This is a client-side Minecraft Fabric mod that allows the 
user to set up audio and visual notifications for when specified words or 
phrases appear in chat.

## Features and Usage

This mod requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for 
configuration (if you aren't using it already, now's a great time to start).

With Mod Menu installed, simply go the mods list, find Chat Notify, click
on the icon, and it's fairly self-explanatory from there.

### Performance

Reasonable effort has been taken to minimise workload, but ultimately it still
has to process every chat message. That said, it is unlikely you will be able 
to detect any performance impact unless you have very large numbers of 
notifications and/or your chat is being spammed extremely fast (e.g. by 
multiple repeating command-blocks).
